Good morning Sir,

Let me introduce myself

I am Alexander Anohin Software Developer by profession, currently staying at Riga (Latvia) with my parents. 

I am born in Riga and have completed Progmeistars courses. Progmeistars - Computer Science. I learned there most of what I know now about Computer Science. They include a lot of things. From programming and algorithms and ending with system administration. I get basic knowledge in many languages.
 After that i have spent 3 years in Latvia University at Computer Science faculty. But it is not finished it and went to work. In parallel i spend 1 year in RISEBA at Business Psychology faculty.

About my studies it all. But of course I try to constantly improve itself. Read a lot of books and listen to different courses.

(Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - (bunch authors) Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides with a foreword by Grady Booch) 

(Clean Code: Robert Cecil Martin)

 My career began in the company SpecialSolutions. Now it is Authentica. I developed and supported a CRM (Customer relationship management) system for government organizations.

 My second job was Apply it .There's quite a strange history. They promised me Java project with Artificial Intelligence. But three months that I have worked - I wrote a small but interesting program which takes information from the video stream, decoded in the correct format, cut into pieces, stored on the server and stores information about this in the database. All this using the C language. Because of the speed. speed - It was very critical question. And as I said a very interesting task. The remaining two months I wrote a site for a local store (supermarket). That's all I've done for this company. And not waiting for the promised Java and AI I went to Qube.

 Qube - Swedish company that develops software for the cows farm. They have a very small and the old Java programmers. I can not tell anything bad about this company - it's just not what I wanted. I have finished the work which we have agreed to leave the company.

 And now I am working in CTE. And we create Casino games.

 My hobbies are playing voleyball (beach voleybal), and ride on all that has wheels but no engine. Roller skates, board (skateboard, waveboard, pennyboard), kick scooter.
